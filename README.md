# Introduction

This repository is built for the CFP of Devoxx - Blockchain As A (new) Database.

## Idea

Media has been talking about the blockchain, decentralized consensus since Bitcoin really caught peopleâ€™s eyes during the year of 2014. We are edging towards this decentralized world with more and more emerging tools.

This presentation will show you how we can use blockchain as the database via a simple "Hello World" decentralized application. The code example will base on the platform [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/], using its smart contract, the building blocks of decentralized applications on Ethereum.

The presentation will start by explaining the core concepts related to the subject: Blockchain, Decentralized consensus, Trustless transaction, Ethereum & Contract.

Then we will proceed with the example of blockchain-based decentralized application. The whole presentation will allow us to catch a glimpse of the future where we combines the benefits of cloud computing with the benefits of P2P technologies in terms of privacy and anonymity to build applications.
